This is an implementation of ResTran. This code is for demonstration purpose.

The implementaions of various downstream machine learning to the transformed vectors are contained in the `examples/codes`.

For the implementaiton of Auxiliary Variational Encoding, we took from https://github.com/wohlert/semi-supervised-pytorch
